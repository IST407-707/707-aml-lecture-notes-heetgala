## Overview

By addressing Heilmeier's catechism, we can provide insight into the following:
Question 1 - What are you trying to do?
The project aims to improve emergency response systems and enhance public safety in New York City by analyzing NYPD call data. By
examining historical records, we aim to uncover insights that can help emergency services respond more effectively to critical situations.
Additionally, we aim to develop a model that can predict crime incidents in specific areas. This proactive approach can enable law
enforcement agencies to allocate resources more effectively, contributing to a safer and more secure environment for residents and
visitors alike.
Question 2 - What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Our approach to analyzing NYPD call data for improving emergency response and predicting crime in New York City is unique in its
thoroughness and methodology. By focusing on detailed data points such as incident timing, location, and call nature, we aim to extract
meaningful insights. Through advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we intend to develop a predictive model. This
model can help identify crime-prone areas and optimize resource allocation. Overall, our approach has the potential to significantly
enhance public safety in the city.
Question 3 - Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
If our project succeeds, it could greatly improve emergency response systems and enhance public safety in New York City. This would
directly benefit law enforcement agencies, key stakeholders, by allowing them to use resources more efficiently and respond more
effectively to emergencies, possibly leading to lower crime rates. Additionally, government agencies and city officials would be interested in the results to improve how they make policies and allocate resources. Ultimately, the general public, who are indirect stakeholders, in New York City would benefit from safer communities and better emergency services.

We are focused on predicting the response time of law enforcement and emergency medical units  

## Data

Dataset is taken from : https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Calls-for-Service-Year-to-Date-/n2zq-pubd/about_data

After this you will include interesting results from your exploratory data analysis.  I'd like to see information about distributions (possibly just a bit of text here if nothing interesting showed up), as well as attempts to visualize data to highlight specific patterns (possibly using dimensionality reductions techniques and / or clustering).  

## Preprocessing

If your data required some preprocessing (surely it did!) document your techniques here.  If this resulted in interesting transformations, you can include examples in code and visualizations to help me understand how the data was transformed.  If you did any sophisticated imputations (e.g. a custom imputation method) feel free to include a code snippet to show me how this was done.

## Modeling

You should have done some initial modeling at this point - for instance, running a simple random forest classifier or MLP to get some baseline information about the performance of your model.  Include any relevant statistic (e.g. F1-scores, confusion matrices, etc.).

## Problems & Challenges

We are yet to find the baseline for our modelling technique and how to go about it. We are going to try different techniques to fnd the best solution and predict the response time of the units.
